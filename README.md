# reminder-discord-bot
basic discord reminder bot that sends a dm

## Setup
- set your discord bot token in the bot.py file
- set your userid in the bot.py file
- replace all placeholder texts with your own custom texts
- add your reminders in schedule.json

## Installation
### Install the required Python libraries
```
pip install discord.py
```

```
pip install pytz
```

## Requirements
- Basic knowladge of computers (Apparently this is difficult for many)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.4/python-3.12.4-amd64.exe)
- a discord account

#### You can run the bot on a cheap server ( I recommend [24fire](https://24fi.re/ref/8BI28ZDJ) )

(thanks to chatgpt for basically creating 90% of the bot)
